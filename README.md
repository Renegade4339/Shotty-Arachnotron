# Shotty-Arachnotron
"Ara ara, Doomguy-sama..." dear god

If two attacks aren't enough, well,
say hello to shotgun-mounted Arachnotrons.

This addon simply adds a shotgun attack that an
Arachnotron will have if their target is within 256
unit radius. ALL Arachnotrons are shotgun-armed now
once this addon is loaded, with the two attacks
intact.
